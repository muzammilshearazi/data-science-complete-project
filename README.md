# data-science-complete-project
### Project Name : Logistic Regression with NumPy and Python

### Project Detail :-

It is a guided project that I did  from coursera.The aim of this project and is to implement all the 
machinery, including gradient descent, cost function, and logistic regression, of the various learning 
algorithms yourself. I used the DMV_Witten_Test.csv dataset which have 100 records with 3 cloumns
[DMV_Test_1 ,DMV_Test_2,Results] and I  applied logistic regreesion on it.I also visulized the dataset 
using different graph sunch as scatter plot , line plot. I trained the dataset by using diffrent fucntion 
such sigmiod function,cost function and gradeint descent.After training I computed the accuracy of logistic 
regression model on given dataset.In the last I gave the new data point to the logestic model and pridict 
the result in term of probability for passing the driving  test.

### Deployment Instruction :-

1- First you should have install python editor such as pycharm or Anaconda3

2- set envoriement variable for the following folder path
C:\Users\Muzammil\Anaconda3
C:\Users\Muzammil\Anaconda3\Scripts
C:\Users\Muzammil\Anaconda3\Library\bin
Note: here I use my windows username so you must use your windows username

3- install all python librries which are using in this project

4- intsall flask by writing this command on command prompt
pip install flask

5- Download the my-app folder from github 

6- Open command promat and go to my-app folder

7- run following command on command prompt
 set FLASK_APP=logistic_regression_app.py

8- After succfully run above command now run the this command 
 flask run --host=0.0.0.0

9- After succfully run above command now open the web browser and write the follwing URL
http://localhost:5000/ 

10- Afte completing nwo you will see the html page put the test scores in teh field and pridict the probabily
 of passing the driving test.

Not:I also provide the link of vedio where you can easily undersatnd the whole project with coding
